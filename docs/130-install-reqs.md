# Define instance strategy

{: .highlight}
> This section is for reference only. No activity required. 

When defining the instance strategy for App Engine Studio, it is recommended to leverage one production instance and at least two sub-production instances – however App Engine Studio can support any number of sub-production instances as part of an instance strategy.

Applications are deployed to the production instance once developed and successfully tested in sub-production instances. One sub-production instance will serve as the development environment, and the other as the test environment.

If your organization uses sandbox or staging environments in addition to test and development, they can be incorporated to the instance strategy accordingly based on organizational needs.

*Example instance strategy with one production instance and three sub-production instances*

Sub-production instances that are most similarly configured to your production instance are the best candidates for test and stage environments. This way, administrators can more accurately find issues that may arise if the application is deployed to production.
