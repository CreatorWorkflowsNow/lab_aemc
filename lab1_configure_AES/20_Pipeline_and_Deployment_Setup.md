# Pipeline and Deployment Setup
{: .no_toc }

**Duration: 30 minutes**
{: .no_toc }

Once App Engine Studio Setup has been completed, administrators must complete the Pipeline and Deployment Guided Setup activities. 

Pipelines enable you to automate the propagation and installation of your applications from one instance to another. Pipelines are powered by the ServiceNow CI / CD spoke, which enables you to automate processes such as publishing applications to the application repository, installing them on target instances, and running ATF tests and/or instance scans.
