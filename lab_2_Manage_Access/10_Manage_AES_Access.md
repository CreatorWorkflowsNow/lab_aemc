Deploy custom applications with confidence by setting up Instance Scan definitions to monitor instance health throughout the deployment process. Instance scans interrogate your instance for configurations and health issues, allowing administrators an opportunity to address best practices and to avoid 
similar configuration issues in the future.

Instance Scan definitions are executed automatically when App Engine Studio applications are promoted to the Testing instance. Instance Scan results will be 
logged in the Notes section of the Deployment Request record.

The App Engine Studio application does not ship with any out-of-box Instance Scan definitions (however a few Instance Scan definitions are installed with the 
Deployment Pipeline plugin to run basic performance checks). 

Work with professional ServiceNow developers to configure Instance Scan definitions and enforce best practices in your environments.
