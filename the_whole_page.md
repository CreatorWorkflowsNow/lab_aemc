# AppEngineStudioOverview

#### _The __content__ in __this__ guide __applies__ to __App__ Engine __Studio__ Version__22.0.3_

App Engine, powered by the Now Platform, fuels rapid delivery of Creator Workflows with great experiences for everyone. With more people building with less complexity, App Engine allows developers to create low-code apps fast, and safely scale cross-enterprise experiences thatusers love.

AppEngine Studio isavailable withAppEngine and isdesigned from the ground up to address low-codedevelopment needs. AppEngine Studio enables professional developers, line of business technologists (citizen developers), and low-code developers to build applications individually orincollaborativeteams onthesameplatform,resultinginfastertimeto valueand better applications that scale without sprawl.

With guidance-driven development flows and pre-configured application templates, developersacrosstheenterprisecanbuildanddeliverappsquickly.Developerscanleverage manyout-of-boxcomponents availablethrough drag-and-dropinterfaces tocreatefulfilling userexperiencesthatarecriticaltoend-useradoption.

# PrepareenvironmentsforAppEngineStudio

Before installing App Engine Studio, review all platform requirements and define an organizational instance strategy to prepare for successful installation and configuration.

## Reviewplatformrequirements

- AppEngineStudioVersion **22.0.3**
- AppEnginelicenserequired

- _Contact __your__ ServiceNow __Account__ Manager __for__ a __dd__ it __io__ n __a__ l __information__ on App Engine, or see_ [_ServiceNow App Engine_](https://www.servicenow.com/products/now-platform-app-engine.html)

- InstancesmustbeonTokyorelease
- **admin** role is requiredinall instances toinstall AppEngine Studio and dependent applications from the ServiceNow Store

## Defineinstancestrategy

WhendefiningtheinstancestrategyforAppEngineStudio,itisrecommendedtoleverageone production instance and at least two sub-production instances – however App Engine Studio cansupport any number of sub-productioninstances as part of aninstance strategy.

Applicationsaredeployedtotheproductioninstanceoncedevelopedandsuccessfullytested in sub-production instances. One sub-production instance will serve as the development environment, and the other as the test environment.

If your organization uses sandbox or staging environments in addition to test and development, theycanbeincorporatedtotheinstancestrategyaccordinglybasedonorganizationalneeds.



_E __x__ a __m__ p __l__ e __instance__ strategy __with__ one __p__ r __o__ d __u__ c __t__ i __o__ n __instance__ and __three__ sub- __p__ r __o__ d __u__ c __t__ i __o__ n__instances_

Sub-production instances that are most similarly configured to your production instance are the best candidates for test and stage environments. This way, administrators can more accurately find issues that may arise if the application is deployed to production.

  1. **Configure**** Instance ****Scan**** definitions**

Deploy custom applicationswith confidence bysetting up Instance Scan definitions to monitor instance health throughout the deployment process. Instance scans interrogate your instance for configurations and health issues, allowing administrators an opportunity to address best practices and to avoid similar configuration issues in the future.

Instance Scan definitions are executed automatically when App Engine Studio applications are promoted to the **Testing** instance. Instance Scan results will be loggedintheNotessectionoftheDeploymentRequestrecord.

TheAppEngineStudioapplicationdoesnotshipwithanyout-of-boxInstance Scandefinitions(howeverafewInstanceScandefinitionsareinstalledwiththe Deployment Pipeline plugin to run basic performance checks).

Work with professional ServiceNow developers to configure Instance Scan definitions and enforce best practices in your environments.



#### _Enable and configure Instance Scan properties in your production instance if you_ plan to clone!

_For __more__ information __on__ managing __instance__ health __scans,__ see_[_Product_](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=hs-landing-page.html)[_Documentation: Instance Scan_](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=hs-landing-page.html)

  1. **Set**** up ****administrator**** group ****in**** development**

Configure App Engine Studio administrator group membership in the developmentinstancetomanagedevelopmentactivitiesthatoccurinthe development environment.



While development activities will be managed in the development instance, administrators manage application intake, collaboration, and deploymentrequests in production.

Groupmembership doesnotsyncacross instances;therefore,system administratorsarerequiredtoaddusersinboththedevelopmentandproduction instances.

_ **Note** __:__ Group __membership__ does __not__ sync __across__ instances, __therefore__ App __Engine Studio__ administrator __group__ membership __will__ also __need__ to __be__ provisioned __in__ the_ _production __instance__ as __part__ of __the__ Pipelines __and__ Deployment __or__ Application Intake Guided Setup activities_

  1. **Grant**** access ****to**** current ****developers**** in ****development**

Allow existing application developers who are already assigned the **delegated\_developer** role access to the App Engine Studio application by adding them to the 'App Engine Studio Users' assignment group.

_ **Note:** __If__ you __wish__ to __grant multiple__ developers access at one __time, advance__ to__the next step to manage access more efficiently_

  1. **Grant**** access ****to**** other ****users**** in ****development**

After provisioning access for existing developers, grant App Engine Studio access to other users within the organization by adding them to the 'App Engine Studio Users' group.

  - i.e.,singleCredentialAliasrecordnamed'_Pipeline__Credentials'_
- However, if eachenvironment inthe Deployment Pipeline will use different credentials (different usernames / passwords), then CredentialAlias records will be created for each instance in the production instance
  - i.e.,multipleCredentialAliasrecords named'Dev Credentials', 'Test Credentials', 'Stage Credentials', and 'Prod Credentials'

OncethenecessaryCredentialAliasrecord(s)havebeencreated,navigate

tothe'Credentials'RelatedListandclickNewtoaddcredentialdetails.

Select Basic Auth Credentials to populate the Basic Auth Credentialform (currently,this is theonlyCredentialtypesupportedbyAppEngine Studio).



It is recommended to use a username / password for a service account sothat the password does not expire or change. The account must exist in thetarget instance(s) and have admin permissions.

  1. **Add users to the App Engine**** Studio Administrators group in production **** instance**

Configure App Engine Studio administrator group membership in the productioninstancetomanageapplicationintakeanddeploymentrequests.

Ensure the group membership in production is consistent with the App Engine Studio administrators identified in the development instance.

Groupmembershipdoesnotsyncbetweenenvironmentsandmustbe updated in both production and development.

_ **Note:** _ _If group membership is empty in the production instance, or if the Deployment Pipeline plugin is not installed, the system will refer to App Engine Studio __Administrator__ group __membership__ in __the__ development__instance_

1. **Configure**** sub-production ****instances**

Followthe steps belowto install the 'Deployment Pipeline' plugin ineachsub-production instance.

Once installed, you will be required to configure an environment record in each instance which points to the production (controller) instance.

YouwillalsoenablethesystempropertiesthatwillallowtheAutomatedTest Framework (ATF) suite to run during the deployment process.

- AppCollaborationDescriptors**[sys\_appcollab\_descriptor]**

- AppCollaborationDescriptorPermissions

**[sys\_appcollab\_permission\_m2m]**

- CollaborationUsersandGroupstables:

When an application is submitted for IT review, the system generates and assigns a Deployment Request record to the App Engine Studio Administrators group.

## Promoteanapplicationinapipeline

When application developers submit an application for IT review, App Engine Studio administrators are assigned Approval records for the Deployment Requests.

Applications are promoted to the next instance in the Deployment Pipeline when administrators approve a request. Only one administrator is required to approve or reject a request.

If arequest is approved,the systemwill trigger asub-flowtopromote the applicationtothe next environment, as defined by Deployment Pipeline configuration.

Each timean application is promoted to a new instanceadministrators will be assigned a new Approval record. When approved, the applicationwill be promoted to the next instance in thepipeline. This continues until the application is promoted to the production instance.

## Reviewandtestanapplication

Once an application has been promoted to theTesting instance, it should bethoroughly tested andreviewedbytheapplicationdeveloper,experiencedServiceNowdevelopers,and functional IT resources to ensure that the application works as expected and existing platform functionality is not impacted. Assign application roles in the test environment appropriately so that users can complete necessary testing activities.

As part of the application deployment process, Automated Test Framework (ATF) tests / suites and Instance Scan definitions will automatically run when the application is promoted to an instanceofType=Testing(ifmultipleinstancesareconfiguredwithType=Testing,thenthetest suites and definitions will run on each instance). ATF and Instance Scan results will be logged in the Notes section of the Deployment Request and available in the 'Deployment EnvironmentResults' related list.

As your citizen development program scales, consider implementing an application 'risk profile' to dictate the level of testing required to more efficiently allocate testing resources. For example, an application containing a Script Include will have a higher risk profile than an application built with a template and minimal configurations, and therefore will require more rigorous testing).

## Rejectanapplication

If anapplicationfails testing or requires additional development work,administrators canreject anapplicationbyclicking **'** Reject'ontheassignedapprovalrecord.

If you reject an application,provide clear feedbackto developer(s) so they can quickly correct the configurations. The Deployment Request 'State' will change to **Closed – Rejected** and the requestor will receive an email notification informing of the rejection.

Application developerscan incorporatefeedbackand continueto submittheapplication forIT review.

# FAQs

### CanapplicationsbeaccessedfromAppEngineStudiotoServiceNowStudio,andvice-versa?

Yes.ApplicationsbuiltinAppEngineStudioareaccessiblefromServiceNowStudio.

All application configurations are captured in the application scope, regardless of the development studio the configurations are performed in.

There are several capabilities available in ServiceNow Studio that are not accessible from App Engine Studio, including business rules, client scripts, and notifications.

**Does**** App ****Engine**** Studio ****support**** domain ****separation?**

DomainseparationisnotsupportedforAppEngineStudio.Thedomainfieldmayexiston datatables, but there is no business logic to manage the data.

**Can App**** Engine Studio applications be integrated ****with other applications outside of**  **ServiceNow?**

Yes, App Engine Studios can interact with third-party systems by leveraging IntegrationHub spokes / actions exposed through Flow Designer.

**How**** can ****I**** safely ****expose**** third-party ****integrations**** in ****App**** Engine ****Studio?**

Consider pre-configuring authorized sub-flows for application developers to use when sharing data with third-party systems instead of allowing App Engine Studio developers to access IntegrationHub actions via Flow Designer.

This way, developers are not directly accessing any third-party systems, and data is shared and presented in a consistent manner across all applications built in App Engine Studio.

**How**** are Deployment ****Requests created**** and ****managed?**

DeploymentRequestsaregeneratedandassignedtoAppEngineStudioAdministrators in the production instance when application developers submit an application for IT review.

**How to**** enable ****other**** applications ****to**** read ****data**** in the ****application's**** table(s)?**

Updatethe'ApplicationAccess'propertyforeachtableinanapplicationtomakeits data accessible to other applications.

**Are**** App ****Engine Studio**** applications built ****in**** a ****private application**** scope?**

Yes,eachapplicationisdevelopedinitsownscope.

**How**** do ****I**** upgrade ****the**** App ****Engine**** Studio ****application?**

AdministratorscanupdatetheAppEngineStudioapplicationintheServiceNowStore.

**How**** can ****I**** manage ****developers**** of ****varying**** experience ****and**** skill ****in**** App ****Engine**** Studio?**

Consider creating multiple development groups in App Engine Studio for developers ofdifferent skill levels. Leverage delegated development to modify group access to builder tools accordingly.

Experienced developers may have more freedom with App Engine Studio tools and featuresthanlow-codedevelopers,whomayhavefewerpermissionsintheapplication.

**Can**** I ****integrate**** App ****Engine**** Studio ****with Source**** Control?**

Yes,applicationdeveloperscanintegratewithaGitSourceControlrepositorytosave and manage multiple versions of an application from a sub-production instance.

_For __more__ information,__see:_

- [_Product __Documentation:__ Source __C__ o __n__ t __r__ o __l__ integration __in__ App __Engine__ Studio_](https://docs.servicenow.com/csh?topicname=aes-source-control-integration.html)
- [_Home __-__ ServiceNow__Developers_](https://developer.servicenow.com/)

**Can**** I ****turn**** off ****the**** automatic execution ****of**** ATF ****tests and**** Instance Scan ****definitions?**

No, unless a new flow is created and the 'Deployment Environment Type Flow' Decision Table[**sys\_decision**]isupdatedtopointtothenewflowforenvironmentswithinstance type of 'Testing'.

If the ATFsystemproperties are not enabled inthe testing instance as part of the guided setup, you will receive a warning during deployment, however the flow will continue.
